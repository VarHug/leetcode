// Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

// Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

// Example 1:
// Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
// Output: True
// Example 2:
// Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
// Output: False
// Note:
// The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
// The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
// n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
